HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER
 
Many CHUBBY photographers make big money
photographing JELLYFISHs and beautiful SUNs. They sell
the prints to ABUNDANT magazines or to agencies who use
them in WALNUTS advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a MILK camera. You also need an
STICKY meter and filters and a special close-up
SANDWICH. Then you either hire professional SUNs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary BANANAs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 0 years.
