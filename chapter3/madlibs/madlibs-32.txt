HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER
 
Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing WALNUTSs and beautiful SANDWICHs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in BANANA advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a ARMY camera. You also need an
BITTER meter and filters and a special close-up
JIGSAW. Then you either hire professional SANDWICHs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary CATs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very DELICATELY for at
least -5 years.
