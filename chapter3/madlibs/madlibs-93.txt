in a strange and topsy-turvy SUN. There she discovers she
can become a tall MILK or a small VIOLIN simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ZEUS. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White PANTHER, the GRUMPY Hatter,
the Cheshire JELLYFISH, and even the Queen of JIGSAWs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an BITTER
end when Alice awakens from her JIGSAW.
