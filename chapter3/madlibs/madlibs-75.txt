when she BAKEDs down a/an CHUBBY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy ARMY. There she discovers she
can become a tall SUN or a small JIGSAW simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic SANDWICH. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RESPECTs such remarkable
characters as the White BANANA, the STICKY Hatter,
the Cheshire ZEUS, and even the Queen of MILKs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an BITTER
end when Alice awakens from her MILK.
